Project 3 - Spyware README file

notes for future improvements:
clang++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -o./hsort.x
-I. -I/home/courses/cop4530p/LIB/cpp -I/home/courses/cop4530p/LIB/tcpp hsort.cpp
The above is the compile command I used to make hsort.cpp. This is also the same
line that I can use to compile sort_spy.cpp with the appropriate changes. How
can I automate this between files? Maybe make a variable that would replace in
this instant hsort.cpp and produce the appropriate executable or simple a
makefile with different section?
